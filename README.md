# GODOT--LIGHT_SPEED_RAY_CASTING_VOXELS-DDA_SDF_VOXEL_RENDERING

Godot Version: 3.4.stable
My System: MacBook Pro Intel Iris 1536 MB (Without NVIDIA)
It's slow when using Texture3D voxel maps. It's either cause I'm using a Mac or I'm using an old Mac (the kind that DOESN'T have an NVIDIA GPU). Try it out, it should run faster with better hardware.

The voxels might be a bit dirty and they might be surrounded by bubbles.
